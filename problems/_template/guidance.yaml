        Real World Application 1

        Explain where this pattern appears in real systems.
        Include specific examples from industry if possible.
        Help learners connect abstract algorithms to practical use.

        Another domain where this pattern is useful.

  solution_approach:
    steps:
      - "Step 1: Initialize (describe setup)"
