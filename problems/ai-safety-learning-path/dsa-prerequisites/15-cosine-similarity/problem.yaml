  🚀 MISSION: Find Similar Embeddings
  
  Your spacecraft's semantic search needs to find documents similar to a query.
  Cosine similarity measures the angle between embedding vectors:
  
  cos_sim(A, B) = (A · B) / (||A|| × ||B||)
  
  Result is in [-1, 1]: 1 = identical direction, 0 = orthogonal, -1 = opposite

examples:
  - input:
      A: [1, 0, 0]
      B: [1, 0, 0]
    output: 1.0
    explanation: "Identical vectors have cosine similarity 1"
  
  - input:
      A: [1, 0]
      B: [0, 1]
    output: 0.0
    explanation: "Orthogonal vectors have cosine similarity 0"

constraints:
  - "Vectors have same dimension"
  - "At least one vector must be non-zero"
