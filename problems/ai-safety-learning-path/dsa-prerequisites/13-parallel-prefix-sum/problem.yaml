  🚀 MISSION: Parallelize Sequential Computations
  
  Many RL computations seem sequential (like cumulative sums for returns),
  but can be parallelized using the "scan" pattern!
  
  Implement parallel prefix sum that runs in O(log n) parallel steps
  instead of O(n) sequential steps.

examples:
  - input:
      values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    output: [1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36]
    explanation: "Prefix sums: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, ...]"

constraints:
  - "Array length is power of 2"
  - "1 <= len(values) <= 2^20"

starter_code:
  python: |
    from typing import List
    
    def parallel_prefix_sum(values: List[float]) -> List[float]:
        """
        Compute prefix sums in O(log n) parallel steps.
        """
        # Your code here
        pass

complexity:
  time: "O(n) work, O(log n) parallel depth"
  space: "O(n)"
