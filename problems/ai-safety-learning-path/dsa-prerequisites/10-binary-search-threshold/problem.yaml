  🚀 MISSION: Find Optimal Detection Threshold
  
  Your spacecraft's anomaly detector outputs confidence scores [0, 1].
  You need to find the threshold that maximizes F1 score!
  
  Given sorted predictions and true labels, use binary search to
  efficiently find the optimal classification threshold.

examples:
  - input:
      scores: [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9]
      labels: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
    output: 0.4
    explanation: "Threshold 0.4 gives best F1 (all predictions correct)"

constraints:
  - "Scores are sorted in ascending order"
  - "Labels are 0 or 1"
  - "1 <= len(scores) <= 10000"

starter_code:
  python: |
    from typing import List
    
    def find_optimal_threshold(
        scores: List[float], 
        labels: List[int]
    ) -> float:
        """
        Find threshold that maximizes F1 score using binary search.
        """
        # Your code here
        pass

  time: "O(n log n)"
