  🚀 MISSION: Trace Information Flow in Neural Networks
  
  In transformer interpretability, we analyze how information flows
  through attention layers as a GRAPH problem.
  
  Given attention weights as an adjacency matrix, find all paths
  from input token to output token with weight above threshold.
  
  This is how we identify "circuits" in transformer models!

examples:
  - input:
      attention: [[0, 0.9, 0.1], [0, 0, 0.8], [0, 0, 0]]
      start: 0
      end: 2
      threshold: 0.5
    output: [[0, 1, 2]]
    explanation: |
      Path 0→1→2 has weights 0.9 * 0.8 = 0.72 > threshold
      Direct path 0→2 has weight 0.1 < threshold

constraints:
  - "attention is square matrix (n × n)"
  - "0 <= attention[i][j] <= 1"
  - "0 < threshold < 1"

starter_code:
  python: |
    from typing import List
    
    def find_attention_paths(
        attention: List[List[float]], 
        start: int, 
        end: int,
        threshold: float
    ) -> List[List[int]]:
        """
        Find all paths from start to end with combined weight >= threshold.
        """
        # Your code here
        pass
