  🚀 MISSION: Track Statistics in Real-Time
  
  Your spacecraft's RL agent needs to normalize observations on-the-fly.
  But you can't store all past observations!
  
  Implement Welford's algorithm for online mean and variance computation:
  - Update with each new sample in O(1)
  - Use O(1) memory regardless of how many samples seen

examples:
  - input:
      samples: [10, 20, 30]
    output:
      mean: 20.0
      variance: 66.67
      std: 8.16

constraints:
  - "Samples arrive one at a time (streaming)"
  - "Cannot store all samples"

    class RunningStats:
        def __init__(self):
            # Your code here
            pass
        
        def update(self, x: float):
            """Update statistics with new sample."""
            # Your code here
            pass
        
        def mean(self) -> float:
            # Your code here
            pass
        
        def variance(self) -> float:
            # Your code here
            pass
        
        def std(self) -> float:
            # Your code here
            pass
        
        def normalize(self, x: float) -> float:
            """Normalize x using running statistics."""
            # Your code here
            pass

complexity:
  time: "O(1) per update"
  space: "O(1)"
