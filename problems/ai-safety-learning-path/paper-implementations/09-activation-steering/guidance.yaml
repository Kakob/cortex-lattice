title: "Activation Steering"
pattern: "Interpretability / Control"
difficulty: "hard"

why_this_matters: |
  Activation steering allows fine-grained control over model behavior
  without retraining. Important for runtime safety interventions.

    - text: "Adding vectors during inference changes behavior"

  common_mistakes:
    - text: "Wrong layer selection (early vs late layers)"
    - text: "Steering strength too high causes incoherence"
