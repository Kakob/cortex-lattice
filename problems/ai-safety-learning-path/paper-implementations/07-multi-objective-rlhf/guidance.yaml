pattern: "Multi-Objective Optimization"
difficulty: "expert"

why_this_matters: |
  Real AI systems must balance multiple objectives.
  Being helpful AND harmless requires careful trade-offs.

  key_concepts:
    - text: "Pareto optimality: can't improve one objective without hurting another"
    - text: "Scalarization: convert multi-objective to single weighted sum"
    - text: "Adaptive weights: adjust based on current performance"
  
  common_mistakes:
    - text: "Fixed weights ignore dynamics during training"
    - text: "Objectives may conflict more than expected"
